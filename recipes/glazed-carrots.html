    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
         <li>1 to 1 1/2 pounds carrots with tops, all similar size and thickness, peeled and halved lengthwise, 1/3 cup tops coarsely chopped and reserved</li>
         <li>Coarse salt and freshly ground pepper</li>
         <li>2 tablespoons packed light-brown sugar</li>
         <li>1 tablespoon molasses</li>
         <li>¼ cup grapeseed oil</li>
         <li>1 ½ tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
         <li>1 sprig fresh rosemary</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add carrots and season with salt 
        and pepper; stir to coat with oil. Let cook for 3 minutes, then add brown sugar 
        and molasses; stir to coat. Cook until carrots are tender and sauce is thick, 
        5 to 8 minutes, adding 1/2 to 1 cup water as necessary to prevent sugar from burning.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat grapeseed oil in a small skillet over medium-high heat. Add reserved 
        carrot tops and cook until crisp. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate and set aside.</li>
        <li>Add butter and rosemary to skillet; cook until butter is melted. Remove rosemary and 
        discard. Transfer carrots to a serving dish and sprinkle with reserved fried tops.</li>
    </ol>
