        <li>one 1-ounce package dried porcini mushrooms</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided</li>
        <li>24 ounces wild mushrooms, trimmed & cut into 1/2-inch pieces</li>
        <li>1 large yellow onion, diced</li>
        <li>2 ribs celery, finely diced</li>
        <li>8 cloves garlic, finely chopped or grated</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons finely chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons finely chopped hardy fresh herbs</li>
        <li>6 ounces finely grated asiago (roughly 1 1/2 cups)</li>
        <li>2 ounces grated parmesan (roughly 1/2 cup)</li>
        <li>3 large eggs, whisked</li>
        <li>kosher salt & ground black pepper, to season</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol id="olcorners">
        <li>Prepare bread cubes. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Slice or tear the bread into 1/2-inch cubes. 
            Set the cubes on a baking sheet, spreading them out in an even layer. Transfer to the oven to toast 
            until dried out, 10-15 minutes. Set aside to cool before mixing the bread cubes in the stuffing.</li>
        <li>Add the vegetable broth, dried porcini mushrooms & bay leaf to a small saucepan over medium-high heat. 
            Bring to a boil & reduce to a gentle simmer. Simmer 10 minutes to reconstitute the mushrooms. 
            Use a slotted spoon or spider strainer to remove the mushrooms & bay leaf from the pot, allowing all 
            excess liquid to drain back into the pot. Transfer reconstituted porcini mushrooms to a cutting board & 
            finely chop. Transfer the chopped mushrooms to the bowl with the prepared bread cubes. Discard the bay 
            leaf & remove the porcini-infused stock from the heat. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, as the porcini mushrooms reconstitute, brown the fresh mushrooms. Add 4 tablespoons of the 
            unsalted butter to an 11-inch cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. Once melted, add the mushrooms. 
            Cook, stirring occasionally, until deeply browned & golden, about 10-12 minutes. Transfer the browned 
            mushrooms to the bowl with the bread cubes. Season with 2 teaspoons kosher salt & ground black pepper 
            as desired. Return skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Add the remaining 2 tablespoons of unsalted butter to the cast iron skillet. Once melted, add the onion 
            & celery, seasoning with 1 teaspoon kosher salt & ground black pepper as desired. Cook, stirring occasionally, 
            until softened & fragrant, about 5-6 minutes. Add in the garlic & fresh herbs. Cook, stirring constantly, 
            until fragrant, about 1-2 minutes longer. Remove from the heat & transfer to the bowl with the bread cubes & mushrooms.</li>
        <li>Add the grated asiago & grated parmesan to the mixing bowl with the bread mixture. Pour the eggs over top. 
            Toss well to combine. Pour in 1 cup of the porcini-infused stock & toss well to combine. The egg & stock 
            should rehydrate the bread cubes such that they’re softened but not soggy. If they seem a little too dry, 
            add in 1/2 cup more stock & toss well to combine. Repeat once more with the remaining stock if needed. 
            Transfer the mushroom stuffing to the same skillet used to cook the aromatics.</li>
        <li>Bake at 350 degrees, uncovered, for 50-60 minutes, until the top of the stuffing is crispy & browned. Serve 
            immediately. Enjoy!</li>
